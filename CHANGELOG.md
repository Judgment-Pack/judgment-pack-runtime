# Changelog

All notable changes to tagged releases are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Add a `NOTICE` file identifying Brian Jin as the copyright holder and carrying
  the attribution required for the embedded Judgment Pack Specification artifacts, and ship it in
  the release archives.
- Record the embedded specification bundle in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`. The bundle is Apache-2.0
  material from a separate project and appears in neither `go.mod` nor `go.sum`, so the previous
  Go-modules-only framing omitted it.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-07-23

- Establish `judgment-pack-runtime` as the vendor-neutral reference runtime for the Judgment Pack
  Specification (JPS) under the `Judgment-Pack` organization. This project originated as the
  `protoss-cli` reference validator and was renamed and relocated to a vendor-neutral home; it is a
  reference implementation, not the only valid one.
- Provide the offline `judgment-pack spec` command namespace (`validate`, `test-conformance`,
  `schema`) plus `version`, built as the `judgment-pack` binary with a `jpack` short alias.
- Implement strict carrier, structural, semantic, and extension-capability validation. The runtime
  validates documents only; it does not evaluate rules, choose an outcome, or authorize an action,
  matching the JPS `0.1.0-draft` scope (no evaluator conformance class).
- Embed and integrity-check JPS `v0.1.0-draft`, pinned byte-for-byte to its immutable upstream
  release tag.
- Provide bundled and local conformance-suite execution, versioned JSON output, and stable process
  exit classes.
- Provide cross-platform release archives, SHA-256 checksums, and build-provenance attestations.

### Known follow-ups

- The embedded specification bundle is still pinned to the pre-neutralization upstream tag
  (`protossai/judgment-pack-spec@v0.1.0-draft`). Re-vendoring to a neutral, digest-locked spec tag
  is pending the specification project publishing one.
- No `GOVERNANCE`/`MAINTAINERS`/`CODEOWNERS` files exist yet. (The `NOTICE` file is added in
  Unreleased. `LICENSE` is deliberately left byte-identical to the canonical Apache-2.0 text: its
  appendix is a template for marking your own files, not a field to fill, and editing it costs a
  clean Apache-2.0 match on automated license scanners. The copyright holder is named in `NOTICE`.)
